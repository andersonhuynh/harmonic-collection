  <!--The idea of miscellaneous items collected over a period that reside in our personal 
    spaces has always intrigued me. The theme of my harmonic collection is “What’s in my blank” 
    the blank signifying a part of my life or a portion of my life where I have collected things 
    in something I own. For example, my backpack that I bring to school and flights back home has 
    accumulated so much random junk over the past year of me using it. I want to scan each item and 
    focus on a thing that I own such as my tote bag one day, my going out bag, or my fridge, and even 
    things as mundane as what's in my jeans pockets. This theme is supposed to give you an insight 
    into my life that week without being too in-depth, You can see things I have done such as if there 
    is a picture of a straw wrapper you know I got a drink that week or a receipt for a restaurant you 
    know I’ve eaten at a restaurant that week, but besides that you know nothing else. I enjoy holding 
    onto small trinkets and memories so this entire theme encapsulates that as a whole.
